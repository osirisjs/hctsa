# *hctsa*, highly comparative time-series analysis

*hctsa* is a software package for running highly comparative time-series analysis using [Matlab](www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) (full support for versions R2014b or later; for use in python cf. [pyopy](https://github.com/strawlab/pyopy)).

The software provides a code framework that allows thousands of time-series analysis features to be extracted from time series (or a time-series dataset), as well as tools for normalizing and clustering the data, producing low-dimensional representations of the data, identifying discriminating features between different classes of time series, learning multivariate classification models using large sets of time-series features, finding nearest matches to a time series of interest, and a range of other visualizations and analyses.

If you use this software, please read and cite these (open access) articles:

Any feedback, as [email](mailto:ben.d.fulcher@gmail.com), [github issues](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa/issues) or [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/), is much appreciated.

### Getting started
&#x1F4D6; &#x1F4D6;
Comprehensive documentation
&#x1F4D6; &#x1F4D6;
for *hctsa* is on [gitbook](https://hctsa-users.gitbook.io/hctsa-manual).

### Downloading the repository

For users unfamiliar with git, the current version of the repository can be downloaded by simply clicking the green *Download .zip* button.

It is recommended to use the repository with git.
For this, please [make a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of it, clone it to your local machine, and then set an [upstream remote](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#step-3-configure-git-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-spoon-knife-repository) to keep it synchronized with the main repository e.g., using the following code:
```
git remote add upstream git://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa.git
```
(make sure that you have [generated an ssh key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/) and associated it with your github account).

You can then update to the latest stable version of the repository by pulling the master branch to your local repository:
```
git pull upstream master
```

For analyzing specific datasets, we recommend working outside of the repository so that incremental updates can be pulled from the upstream repository.
Details on how to merge the latest version of the repository with the local changes in your fork can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).
